CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:96 (add_dependencies):
  The dependency target "vrx_gazebo_generate_messages_cpp" of target
  "gui_task_widget" does not exist.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:83 (add_library):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target gui_task_widget
  because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libuuid.so.1] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/grant/miniconda3/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
