[1.063s] CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:25 (cmake_policy):
[1.063s]   The OLD behavior for policy CMP0054 will be removed from a future version
[1.063s]   of CMake.
[1.063s] 
[1.063s]   The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
[1.064s]   policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
[1.064s]   specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
[1.064s]   behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

[1.072s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
[1.072s]   By not providing "Findcatkin.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[1.072s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "catkin", but
[1.072s]   CMake did not find one.
[1.073s] 
[1.073s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin" with any
[1.073s]   of the following names:

[1.073s]     catkinConfig.cmake

[1.073s] 
[1.073s]   Add the installation prefix of "catkin" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[1.073s]   "catkin_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "catkin"
[1.073s]   provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
[1.073s]   installed.
